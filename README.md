# PyDNet on mobile devices v2.0
This repository contains the source code to run PyDNet on mobile devices.

# What's new?
In v2.0, we changed the procedure and the data used for training. More information will be provided soon...

Moreover, we build also a web-based demonstration of the same network! You can try it now [here](https://filippoaleotti.github.io/demo_live/).
The model runs directly on your browser, so anything to install!

## iOS
The iOS demo has been developed by [Giulio Zaccaroni](https://github.com/GZaccaroni).

XCode is required to build the app, moreover you need to sign in with your AppleID and trust yourself as certified developer.
